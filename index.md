[Jrnlr](https://github.com/bkchu/jrnlr) - An online journal with social media capabilities. With mobile-first responsive design, this web-app was created using cutting-edge JavaScript technologies from front to back including but not limited to: React, Redux, Node, Express, and PostgresQL. The live website is [here](https://www.jrnlr.me).

[MEBU Property Management Application](https://github.com/MEBUPropertyManagement/mebu) - MEBU is a full-stack application that allows property owners to manage their real estate, units, residents, and finances, and where tenants are able to handle maintenance requests and pay their rent. The live website is [here](https://mebu.herokuapp.com).

[Anon-QQ -- Anonymous, Real-Time WebSockets Application for Student Questions](https://github.com/MichaelKovich/anon-qq) - For this project, a classmate and I challenged ourselves to learn a new technology and implement it in a practical way within roughly ten working hours. Understanding that students sometimes feel hesitant to raise questions in front of their peers, Anon-QQ was developed. Within the application, students are free to submit questions with anonymity amongst peers, though instructors can see their names to track engagement. Instructors are able to create unique, isolated rooms for their particular classes. The live website is [here](https://anon-qq.herokuapp.com).

[InstaTube](https://github.com/bkchu/youtube-react) - A project designed to bring YouTube videos for your enjoyment, but faster. I solidified understanding of React's unidirectional data-flow, state, props, lifecycle hooks, and API calls. The live website is [here](https://instatube-react.herokuapp.com).
